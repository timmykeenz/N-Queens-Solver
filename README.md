# N-Queens-Solver
N-Queens brute force solver.  It is inefficient, but it works... eventually.  This project was built in my Databases class at Monroe Community College with Daniel Breslawski.  This was one of my favorite school-related projects as solving it was extremely satisfying.  We were given an imcomplete version of the Node and LinkedStack class (Provided through University of Colorodo) that we had to complete.  After that, we worked together to build the solution to the N-Queens problem.

### Description
The QueenSimulation.java is the file contatining main.  This solves the N-Queens problem, in which one is challenged to place n queens on a chessboard of size (n by n) squares so that none of the queens can attack or be attacked by any others.  This project utilizes the stack data structure to push, peak, and pop queens on and off the chessboard.  Once it finds a viable solution, it will print it to the console.
