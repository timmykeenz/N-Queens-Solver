# N-Queens-Solver
N-Queens brute force solver.  It is inefficient, but it works... eventually.

### Description
The QueenSimulation.java is the file contatining main.  This solves the N-Queens problem, in which one is challenged to place n queens on a chessboard of size (n by n) squares so that none of the queens can attack or be attacked by any others.  This project utilizes the stack data structure to push, peak, and pop queens on and off the chessboard.  Once it finds a viable solution, it will print it to the console.
